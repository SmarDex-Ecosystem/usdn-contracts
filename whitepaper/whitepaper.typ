  title: [Ultimate Synthetic Delta Neutral],
  abstract: [
    This paper present a new decentralized protocol proposing two defi products : making yield by being exposed in dollar and long leverage trading.
    These two systems work in pair to be operational and secure. A new token is introduce, USDN, tradable and making value over time.
    To ensure good health of the protocol, both products need to be at equilibrium. We describe in this paper how we are using funding and imbalance limits to ensure the right behavior of the protocol.

= Introduction

The decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem has long sought alternatives to fiat-backed tokens, aiming to provide users
with assets that combine dollar-like stability with yield generation. However, existing solutions, particularly stablecoins, suffer
from inherent flaws: they are often centralized, opaque, and yield-free for holders.
