# Deployments

## Set parameters

Environment variables can be used to control the script execution:

- `FORK_CHAIN_ID`: the chain ID of the anvil fork. If deploying on mainnet (production), this variable can be omitted.
- `DEPLOYER_ADDRESS`: required, the address that is used for simulating the transactions on the network fork (needs to have a sufficient balance).
- `FEE_COLLECTOR` : required, the receiver of all protocol fees
- `SDEX_ADDRESS`: if provided, skips deployment of the mock SDEX token
- `WSTETH_ADDRESS`: if provided, skips deployment of the mock wstETH token
- `MIDDLEWARE_ADDRESS`: if provided, skips deployment of the oracle middleware
- `PYTH_ADDRESS`: required if middleware address not provided, the contract address of the pyth oracle
- `PYTH_ETH_FEED_ID`: required if middleware address not provided, the price ID of the ETH pyth oracle
- `REDSTONE_ETH_FEED_ID`: required if middleware address not provided, the feed ID of the ETH Redstone oracle
- `CHAINLINK_ETH_PRICE_ADDRESS`: required if middleware address not provided, the address of the ETH chainlink oracle
- `CHAINLINK_ETH_PRICE_VALIDITY`: the amount of time (in seconds) we consider the price valid. A tolerance should be added to avoid reverting if chainlink misses the heartbeat by a few minutes
- `LIQUIDATION_REWARDS_MANAGER_ADDRESS`: if provided, skips deployment of the liquidation rewards manager
- `REBALANCER_ADDRESS`: if provided, skips deployment of the rebalancer
- `CHAINLINK_GAS_PRICE_VALIDITY`: the amount of time (in seconds) we consider the price valid. A tolerance should be added to avoid reverting if chainlink misses the heartbeat by a few minutes
- `USDN_ADDRESS`: required if running `02_Deploy.s.sol` in a production environment (not fork)
- `INIT_DEPOSIT_AMOUNT`: amount to use for the `initialize` function call (if not provided, then initialization is skipped).
- `INIT_LONG_AMOUNT`: amount to use for the `initialize` function call (if not provided, then initialization is skipped).
- `INIT_LONG_LIQPRICE`: desired liquidation price for the initial long position. For fork deployment, this value is
  ignored and the price is calculated to get a leverage of ~2x.
- `GET_WSTETH`: whether to get wstETH by sending ether to the wstETH contract or not. Only applicable if `WSTETH_ADDRESS` is given.

Example using the real wstETH and depositing 1 ETH for both vault side and long side (with liquidation
at 1 USD so a leverage close to 1x):
Will also link oracles to mainnet instances:

export GET_WSTETH=true
```

## Deploy protocol

Initializing the contract (when `INIT_DEPOSIT_AMOUNT` and `INIT_LONG_AMOUNT` are defined) requires enough wstETH to make
the deposit and open the long position.

If `WSTETH_ADDRESS` is defined and `GET_WSTETH=true`, then the script will wrap some ether before initializing the
contract so that there is enough balance.

```
forge script --non-interactive --private-key 0xac... -f http://localhost:8545 script/02_Deploy.s.sol:Deploy --broadcast
```

## Anvil fork configuration

The `anvil` fork should be launched with at least the following parameters:

- `-a 100` to fund 100 addresses with 10'000 Îž
- `-f https://..` to fork mainnet at the latest height
- `--chain-id $FORK_CHAIN_ID` to change from the default (1) forked chain ID

```
anvil -a 100 -f [Mainnet RPC] --chain-id $FORK_CHAIN_ID
```

## Logs analysis command

This utility gathers all the logs emitted from the deployed contracts and prints them nicely into the console.

The script first requires that the ABIs have been exported with `npm run exportAbi`.

Then, it can be used like so:

```
npx ts-node script/logsAnalysis.ts -r https://fork-rpc-url.com/ --protocol 0x24EcC5E6EaA700368B8FAC259d3fBD045f695A08 --usdn 0x0D92d35D311E54aB8EEA0394d7E773Fc5144491a --middleware 0x4278C5d322aB92F1D876Dd7Bd9b44d1748b88af2
```

The parameters are the RPC URL and the deployed addresses of the 3 main contracts.
