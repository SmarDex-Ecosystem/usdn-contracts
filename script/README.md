# Scripts

## Deploy USDN token

### Production mode

The script verifies that the deployer address has a nonce of 0. It then deploys the token. Finally, it grants the `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` to the safe address and renounces this role from the deployer.

Use the following command to deploy the USDN token:

```shell
./script/deployUsdnToken.sh -r RPC_URL -s SAFE_ADDRESS
```

It will then prompt you to enter the deployer's private key.

Help can be displayed with the `-h` flag.

```shell
./script/deployUsdnToken.sh -h
```

A test mode is available with the `-t` or `--test` flag. It will deploy the token with default values (rpc url: localhost:8545, deployer: 29th account of anvil, safe: EthSafeAddr).

```shell
./script/deployUsdnToken.sh -t
```

### Standalone mode

You can run the forge script directly with the following command:

```shell
forge script --private-key PRIVATE_KEY -f RPC_URL script/00_DeployUsdn.s.sol:DeployUsdn --broadcast --slow
```

Two environment variables are required: `DEPLOYER_ADDRESS` and `SAFE_ADDRESS`.

## Deploy WUSDN token

Use the following command to deploy the WUSDN token:

```shell
forge create --rpc-url RPC_URL --constructor-args USDN_ADDRESS \
    --private-key PRIVATE_KEY src/Usdn/Wusdn.sol:Wusdn
```

It will then prompt you to enter the deployer's private key.

Help can be displayed with the `-h` flag.

```shell
./script/deployUsdnToken.sh -h
```

A test mode is available with the `-t` or `--test` flag. It will deploy the token with default values (rpc url: localhost:8545, deployer: 29th account of anvil, safe: EthSafeAddr).

```shell
./script/deployUsdnToken.sh -t
```

## Deploy protocol

### Production mode

For a mainnet deployment, you have to use the shell script. The required variables are:

- the safe address (that will be the owner of the protocol)
- the rpc url
- the USDN token address

```shell
deployMainnet.sh -s SAFE_ADDRESS -r RPC_URL -u USDN_ADDRESS
```

example:

```shell
./script/deployMainnet.sh -r 127.0.0.1:8545 -s 0x1E3e1128F6bC2264a19D7a065982696d356879c5 -u 0xde17a000ba631c5d7c2bd9fb692efea52d90dee2
```

Two optional flags are available:

- `-w` to get wstETH by sending ether to the wstETH contract
- `-t` to deploy with a hardware wallet (ledger/trezor)

The script can be run with the following command with `--test` flag to deploy with default values. (rpc url: localhost:8545, get wstETH: true, deployer : 29th account of anvil, safe: EthSafeAddr)

### Fork mode

The deployment script for the fork mode does not require any input:

```shell
deployFork.sh
```

### Standalone mode

You can run the forge script directly with the following command:

```shell
forge script script/01_DeployProtocol.s.sol:DeployProtocol -f RPC_URL --private-key PRIVATE_KEY --broadcast
```

Required environment variables: `DEPLOYER_ADDRESS` and `IS_PROD_ENV`. `SAFE_ADDRESS` is required only if `IS_PROD_ENV` is set to `true`. And `INIT_LONG_AMOUNT` is required if `IS_PROD_ENV` is set to `false`.

If running on mainnet, remember to deploy the USDN token first with the `00_DeployUSDN.s.sol` script and set the `USDN_ADDRESS` environment variable.

### Environment variables

Environment variables can be used to control the script execution:

- `INIT_LONG_AMOUNT`: amount to use for the `initialize` function call
- `DEPLOYER_ADDRESS`: the address of the deployer
- `USDN_ADDRESS`: the address of the USDN token
- `WUSDN_ADDRESS`: required if running `01_Deploy.s.sol` in a production environment (not fork)
- `GET_WSTETH`: whether to get wstETH by sending ether to the wstETH contract or not. Only applicable if `WSTETH_ADDRESS` is given.
- `FEE_COLLECTOR`: the receiver of all protocol fees (set to `DEPLOYER_ADDRESS` if not set in the environment)
- `SDEX_ADDRESS`: if provided, skips deployment of the SDEX token
- `WSTETH_ADDRESS`: if provided, skips deployment of the wstETH token
- `MIDDLEWARE_ADDRESS`: if provided, skips deployment of the oracle middleware
- `PYTH_ADDRESS`: the contract address of the pyth oracle
- `PYTH_ETH_FEED_ID`: the price ID of the ETH pyth oracle
- `REDSTONE_ETH_FEED_ID`: the feed ID of the ETH Redstone oracle
- `CHAINLINK_ETH_PRICE_ADDRESS`: the address of the ETH chainlink oracle
- `CHAINLINK_ETH_PRICE_VALIDITY`: the amount of time (in seconds) we consider the price valid. A tolerance should be added to avoid reverting if chainlink misses the heartbeat by a few minutes
- `LIQUIDATION_REWARDS_MANAGER_ADDRESS`: if provided, skips deployment of the liquidation rewards manager
- `REBALANCER_ADDRESS`: if provided, skips deployment of the rebalancer
- `CHAINLINK_GAS_PRICE_VALIDITY`: the amount of time (in seconds) we consider the price valid. A tolerance should be added to avoid reverting if chainlink misses the heartbeat by a few minutes

Example using the real wstETH and depositing 10 ETH for both vault side and long side for mainnet deployment:

```bash
export INIT_LONG_AMOUNT=10000000000000000000
export DEPLOYER_ADDRESS=0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890
export GET_WSTETH=true
export IS_PROD_ENV=true
```

## Upgrade protocol

Each upgrade logic depends on the implementation, so no boilerplate can be used for every upgrade version. This means you need to checkout to the corresponding tag version to see the exact upgrade script used.

Some general rules apply:

- Implement the reinitialization function (ex: `initializeStorageV2`) with the required parameters
  - Make sure it is only callable by the PROXY_UPGRADE_ROLE addresses
  - Make sure it has the `reinitialize` modifier with the correct version
- Add the previous tag of the contract as a dependency in the `foundry.toml` file as well as in the remapping
  - Example: If we deployed tag 0.17.2 and released a new tag 0.17.3, we would need to add 0.17.2 in the `[dependencies]` section,
    like so: `usdn-protocol-previous = { version = "0.17.2", git = "git@github.com:SmarDex-Ecosystem/usdn-contracts.git", tag = "v0.17.2" }`
    and `"usdn-protocol-previous/=dependencies/usdn-protocol-previous-0.17.2/src/"` in the `remappings` variable
  - By doing so, the previous version will be compiled and available for the upgrade script to do a proper validation. You can find the `UsdnProtocolImpl.sol` file at `out/UsdnProtocol/UsdnProtocolImpl.sol/UsdnProtocolImpl.json`
- Change the artifacts' names in `50_Upgrade.s.sol`
  - If needed, change the `opts.referenceContract` option with the correct previous implementation's path
  - If needed, comment the line that re-deploy the fallback contract

If you are ready to upgrade the protocol, then you can launch the bash script `script/upgrade.sh`. It will prompt you to enter a RPC url, the address of the deployed USDN protocol, and a private key. The address derived from the private key must have the `PROXY_UPGRADE_ROLE` role.

## Anvil fork configuration

The `anvil` fork should be launched with at least the following parameters:

- `-a 100` to fund 100 addresses with 10'000 Îž
- `-f https://..` to fork mainnet at the latest height
- `--chain-id $FORK_CHAIN_ID` to change from the default (1) forked chain ID

```bash
anvil -a 100 -f [Mainnet RPC] --chain-id $FORK_CHAIN_ID
```

## Logs analysis command

This utility gathers all the logs emitted from the deployed contracts and prints them nicely into the console.

The script first requires that the ABIs have been exported with `npm run exportAbi`.

Then, it can be used like so:

```bash
npx tsx script/utils/logsAnalysis.ts -r https://fork-rpc-url.com/ --protocol 0x24EcC5E6EaA700368B8FAC259d3fBD045f695A08 --usdn 0x0D92d35D311E54aB8EEA0394d7E773Fc5144491a --middleware 0x4278C5d322aB92F1D876Dd7Bd9b44d1748b88af2
```

The parameters are the RPC URL and the deployed addresses of the 3 main contracts.

## Functions clashes

This utility checks that two contracts don't have a common function selector.
We can specify common base contracts to filter wanted duplications with the `-c` flag.

It can be used like so:

```bash
npx tsx script/utils/functionClashes.ts UsdnProtocolImpl UsdnProtocolFallback -c AccessControlDefaultAdminRulesUpgradeable PausableUpgradeable
```

## Scan Roles

This bash script will scan the blockchain to get the roles of the UsdnProtocol / Usdn / OracleMiddleware and the owner of the LiquidationRewardsManager / Rebalancer contracts.
Then, it will generate files containing the addresses assigned to all the relevant roles and contracts.

you need to run the script with the following arguments:

- `rpc-url`: the RPC URL of the network you want to scan
- `protocol`: the address of the deployed USDN protocol
- `block-number`: the block number to start the scan from (optional)

- example:

```bash
./script/utils/scanRoles.sh --protocol 0x0Fd23cC6c13681ddB9ECE2ae0EEAFaf7a534208f --rpc-url https://sepolia.gateway.tenderly.co --block-number 0
```

You need to provide just the protocol address because the script will automatically fetch the other addresses from the protocol. The script will save the results in 1 csv and json file per contract with access control, and 1 csv and json file total for all the contracts with simple ownership.

## Verify contracts

The verifying script will work with a broadcast file, the compiled contracts and an etherscan API key.
You don't need to be the deployer to verify the contracts.
Before verifying, you need to compile the contracts :

```forge compile```

Be sure to be in the same version as the deployment to avoid bytecode difference.
You can then verify by using this cli:

```bash
npm run verify -- PATH_TO_BROADCAST_FILE -e ETHERSCAN_API_KEY
```

To show some extra debug you can add `-d` flag.
If you are verifying contracts in another platform than Etherscan, you can specify the url with `--verifier-url`  

## Test Scripts

Both scripts are designed to be executed using the Forge CLI. They are used to simulate the acceptance of ownership of the protocol contracts by the Safe address and the initialization of the protocol. Parameters can be specified via environment variables or, if not provided, will be prompted for during execution.

- before the acceptance of ownership by the Safe address, it must be funded with ether. This can be done using the `cast` command of the Forge CLI. For example:

```bash
cast send 0x1E3e1128F6bC2264a19D7a065982696d356879c5 --private-key 0x233c86e887ac435d7f7dc64979d7758d69320906a0d340d2b6518b0fd20aa998 --value 800ether -r 127.0.0.1:8545
```

- **`AcceptOwnership`**: This script is intended for testing purposes only. It simulates the acceptance of ownership for all protocol-related contracts by the Safe address.

```bash
forge script script/52_AcceptOwnership.s.sol -f 127.0.0.1:8545 --broadcast --sender 0x1e3e1128f6bc2264a19d7a065982696d356879c5 --unlocked
```

- **`InitializeProtocol`**: This script is also intended for testing purposes only. It simulates the initialization of the protocol by the Safe address using the specified parameters.

```bash
forge script script/53_InitializeProtocol.s.sol -f 127.0.0.1:8545 --broadcast --sender 0x1e3e1128f6bc2264a19d7a065982696d356879c5 --unlocked
```
