# Deployments

## Set parameters

Environment variables can be used to control the script execution:

#### Required
- `INIT_DEPOSIT_AMOUNT`: amount to use for the `initialize` function call
- `INIT_LONG_AMOUNT`: amount to use for the `initialize` function call

#### Optional
- `DEPLOYER_ADDRESS`: required only for fork deployment, the address of the deployer
- `FEE_COLLECTOR`: set to `DEPLOYER_ADDRESS` if not set, the receiver of all protocol fees
- `SDEX_ADDRESS`: if provided, skips deployment of the SDEX token
- `WSTETH_ADDRESS`: if provided, skips deployment of the wstETH token
- `MIDDLEWARE_ADDRESS`: if provided, skips deployment of the oracle middleware
- `PYTH_ADDRESS`: the contract address of the pyth oracle
- `PYTH_ETH_FEED_ID`: the price ID of the ETH pyth oracle
- `REDSTONE_ETH_FEED_ID`: the feed ID of the ETH Redstone oracle
- `CHAINLINK_ETH_PRICE_ADDRESS`: the address of the ETH chainlink oracle
- `CHAINLINK_ETH_PRICE_VALIDITY`: the amount of time (in seconds) we consider the price valid. A tolerance should be added to avoid reverting if chainlink misses the heartbeat by a few minutes
- `LIQUIDATION_REWARDS_MANAGER_ADDRESS`: if provided, skips deployment of the liquidation rewards manager
- `REBALANCER_ADDRESS`: if provided, skips deployment of the rebalancer
- `CHAINLINK_GAS_PRICE_VALIDITY`: the amount of time (in seconds) we consider the price valid. A tolerance should be added to avoid reverting if chainlink misses the heartbeat by a few minutes
- `USDN_ADDRESS`: required if running `01_Deploy.s.sol` in a production environment (not fork)
- `GET_WSTETH`: whether to get wstETH by sending ether to the wstETH contract or not. Only applicable if `WSTETH_ADDRESS` is given.
- `PROTOCOL_EIP712_VERSION`: If provided, overrides the default values for the usdn protocol version. The current version of the EIP712 signing domain of the usdn protocol. This version must be updated if you wish to break compatibility with previous delegations that have not been used, mostly when upgrading contracts that impact delegations logic.

Example using the real wstETH and depositing 10 ETH for both vault side and long side for mainnet deployment (with liquidation
at 1 USD so a leverage close to 1x):

```
export INIT_DEPOSIT_AMOUNT=10000000000000000000
export INIT_LONG_AMOUNT=10000000000000000000
export GET_WSTETH=true
```

## Deploy protocol

Just run the bash script corresponding to the desired deployment (mainnet or fork).

You will be prompted to enter the `RPC_URL` of the network you want to deploy to (mainnet and sepolia). If you are deploying with a Ledger, you will also be prompted for the deployer address. And without a Ledger, you will be prompted for the deployer private key.  
The deployment script for the fork mode does not require any input.

Only two env variables are required : `INIT_DEPOSIT_AMOUNT` and `INIT_LONG_AMOUNT`.

If `GET_WSTETH=true`, then the script will wrap some ether before initializing the
contract so that there is enough balance.

```
./script/deployMainnet.sh
./script/deployFork.sh
```

## Upgrade protocol

Before you launch the upgrade script, there are a few things you need to do:
* Implement the reinitialization function (ex: `initializeStorageV2`) with the required parameters
  * Make sure it is only callable by the PROXY_UPGRADE_ROLE addresses
  * Make sure it has the `reinitialize` modifier with the correct version
* Add the previous tag of the contract as a dependency in the `foundry.toml` file as well as in the remapping
  * Example: If we deployed tag 0.17.2 and released a new tag 0.17.3, we would need to add 0.17.2 in the `[dependencies]` section, 
    like so: `usdn-protocol-previous = { version = "0.17.2", git = "git@github.com:SmarDex-Ecosystem/usdn-contracts.git", tag = "v0.17.2" }`
    and `"usdn-protocol-previous/=dependencies/usdn-protocol-previous-0.17.2/src/"` in the `remappings` variable
  * By doing so, the previous version will be compiled and available for the upgrade script to do a proper validation. You can find the `UsdnProtocolImpl.sol` file at `out/UsdnProtocol/UsdnProtocolImpl.sol/UsdnProtocolImpl.json`
* Change the artifacts' names in `50_Upgrade.s.sol`
  * If needed, change the `opts.referenceContract` option with the correct previous implementation's path
  * If needed, comment the line that re-deploy the fallback contract

If you are ready to upgrade the protocol, then you can launch the bash script `script/upgrade.sh`. It will prompt you to enter a RPC url, the address of the deployed USDN protocol, and a private key. The address derived from the private key must have the `PROXY_UPGRADE_ROLE` role.

## Anvil fork configuration

The `anvil` fork should be launched with at least the following parameters:

- `-a 100` to fund 100 addresses with 10'000 Îž
- `-f https://..` to fork mainnet at the latest height
- `--chain-id $FORK_CHAIN_ID` to change from the default (1) forked chain ID

```
anvil -a 100 -f [Mainnet RPC] --chain-id $FORK_CHAIN_ID
```

## Logs analysis command

This utility gathers all the logs emitted from the deployed contracts and prints them nicely into the console.

The script first requires that the ABIs have been exported with `npm run exportAbi`.

Then, it can be used like so:

```
npx tsx script/logsAnalysis.ts -r https://fork-rpc-url.com/ --protocol 0x24EcC5E6EaA700368B8FAC259d3fBD045f695A08 --usdn 0x0D92d35D311E54aB8EEA0394d7E773Fc5144491a --middleware 0x4278C5d322aB92F1D876Dd7Bd9b44d1748b88af2
```

The parameters are the RPC URL and the deployed addresses of the 3 main contracts.

## Functions clashes

This utility checks that two contracts don't have a common function selector.
We can specify a common base contract to filter wanted duplications with the `-s` flag.

It can be used like so:

```
npx tsx script/functionClashes.ts UsdnProtocolImpl.sol UsdnProtocolFallback.sol -s UsdnProtocolStorage.sol
```
